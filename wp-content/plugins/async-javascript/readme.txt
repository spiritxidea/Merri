Async JavaScript adds a 'async' or 'defer' attribute to JavaScripts loaded via wp_enqueue_script

== Description ==

When a JavaScript file is loaded via the wp_enqueue_script function, Async JavaScript will add an async or defer attribute.

There are several ways an external JavaScript file can be executed:

* If async is present: The script is executed asynchronously with the rest of the page (the script will be executed while the page continues the parsing)
* If defer is present and async is not present: The script is executed when the page has finished parsing
* If neither async or defer is present: The script is fetched and executed immediately, before the browser continues parsing the page

Using async or defer helps to eliminate render-blocking JavaScript in above-the-fold content. This can also help to increase your pagespeed which in turn can assist in improving your page ranking.

<em>Want more control? </em><strong>Async JavaScript Pro</strong> allows you to:

* Selective ‘async’ – choose which JavaScripts to apply ‘async’ to
* Selective ‘defer’ – choose which JavaScripts to apply ‘defer’ to
* Exclude individual scripts – choose which JavaScripts to ignore
* Exclude plugins – choose local plugin JavaScripts to ignore
* Exclude themes – choose local theme JavaScripts to ignore

== Installation ==

Just install from your WordPress "Plugins | Add New" screen and all will be well. Manual installation is very straight forward as well:

1. Upload the zip-file and unzip it in the /wp-content/plugins/ directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Go to `Settings` - `Async JavaScript` menu to load setings page

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
